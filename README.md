## COMP 410: Data Structures

This repository includes my coursework from COMP 401 at UNC-Chapel Hill taught by Paul Stotts, focusing on the analysis of data structures and associated algorithms.

Class topics included: Abstract data types, lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs, sorting, searching, and hashing.

The assignments in this repository include the implementation of a linked list, binary search tree, min bin heap, splay tree, and digraph.

<b>This is just to keep my work organized. Follow the UNC-CH honor code if you choose to look at this for your own coursework.</b>
